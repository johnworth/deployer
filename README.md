# deployer

A stupidly basic tool to perform deployments to a Discovery Environment integration environment. Could have been written in bash, but I wanted the additional practice writing Go. Don't look here for anything fancy or even pretty.

Requires gb to build it. Needs git, ansible, ansible-playbook, and a checkout of an internal-only iPlant ansible repo.
